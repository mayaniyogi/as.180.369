Steps to Download and Combine Data:
Go to the IPEDS Data Center: IPEDS Data Center.
Select the Institution Characteristics (IC) Dataset:
Once you are on the Data Center page, choose the "Compare Institutions" or "Download Custom Dataset" tool.
Choose the Institutional Characteristics dataset for the latest year available.
Select variables that provide geographic information (e.g., latitude/longitude, institution address).
Select the Finance (F) Dataset:
After retrieving location data, return to the IPEDS Data Center and select the Finance (F) dataset.
Choose the variables that pertain to financial information, such as Endowment Assets, Total Revenues, and Total Expenditures.
Combine the Data:
After downloading both datasets, you can merge them based on a common identifier, such as the Institution ID (UnitID) provided by IPEDS. This will allow you to spatially map university locations with their financial information.
Spatial Analysis:
You can use a GIS tool (e.g., QGIS, ArcGIS) to map the university locations based on the latitude/longitude and perform spatial analyses related to spending or endowment levels.
