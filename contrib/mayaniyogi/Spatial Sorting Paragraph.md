In recent decades, the spatial sorting of educated workers within U.S. cities has shifted dramatically, driven by rising incomes, changes in local labor demand, and preferences for neighborhood amenities. From the 1980s to today, college graduates have increasingly clustered in city centers, displacing lower-income residents to suburban areas and worsening spatial inequality. This sorting has coincided with rising income inequality, which exacerbates residential segregation as wealthier households increase house prices in desirable areas. Models of spatial equilibrium suggest that gentrification of downtown areas benefit wealthier households at the expense of poorer households, further fueling inequality. At the same time, policies like the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) can help revitalize low-income neighborhoods, though their effects vary by location. Some research ideas include exploring how transportation infrastructure or local policies affect the spatial distribution of workers by education level or investigating the impact of affordable housing initiatives like LIHTC on neighborhood efforts and segregation dynamics. Other ideas include studying the impact wealthy, college-educated residents have on the quality of public services in city centers or how neighborhood characteristics--like the level of education or income diversity--impact long-term economic outcomes for children growing up in these areas.

<!-- Other ideas include:Impact of Gentrification on Public Goods: Investigate how gentrification affects access to public goods like schools, parks, and public transit. Do wealthier, college-educated residents improve the quality of public services in city centers, or do they disproportionately benefit while poorer residents get pushed to underserved areas?
Role of Remote Work in Urban Sorting: Explore the recent trend of remote work and its impact on spatial sorting. How has the ability to work remotely influenced the migration patterns of educated workers, and is this reversing or accelerating the clustering of talent in city centers?
Segregation and Social Mobility: Analyze the relationship between residential segregation and intergenerational social mobility. How do neighborhood characteristics, like the level of education or income diversity, impact long-term economic outcomes for children growing up in these areas?
Transportation's Role in Inequality: Examine how improvements in transportation technology, such as ride-sharing apps or new transit lines, influence the spatial sorting of households by income or education. Does better access to transportation mitigate or worsen residential segregation?
Local Labor Markets and Wage Inequality: Investigate how changes in local labor demand within cities contribute to wage inequality between college-educated and non-college-educated workers. What sectors drive these changes, and how does sorting impact local economic development?
Amenity Valuation Across Income Groups: Study how different income or education groups value neighborhood amenities, like restaurants, green spaces, or cultural institutions. What explains the gap in amenity preferences between wealthier downtown residents and displaced suburban households?
Effectiveness of Affordable Housing Policies: Conduct a comparative analysis of affordable housing policies (such as LIHTC) in different cities. How do local variations in policy implementation impact segregation, house prices, and the long-term viability of these neighborhoods?
Link Between Segregation and Health Outcomes: Investigate how spatial segregation impacts public health outcomes, particularly for lower-income residents pushed to suburban areas. Does displacement exacerbate health disparities due to reduced access to healthcare and fresh food options?
These projects could provide new insights into the interplay between urbanization, inequality, and policy interventions in different cities.-->
