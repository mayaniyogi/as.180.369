Agglomeration economies--economies of scale resulting from spatial proximities external to a firm--manifest in various ways in urban settings. This paper aims to quantify the impact of knowledge spillovers on local innovation levels. <--!Knowledge spillovers, quantified by studying university endowment spending rates, are spatially plotted against innovation levels, quantified by number of filed patents.--> University endowment spending, an instrument variable for research activity and education level/output, are spatially plotted against USPTO patent production data to understand the potential knowledge spillover effects between universities and local economies. A moderate relationship between university spending and patent production is found, supporting the idea that knowledge spillovers boost innovation in local economies. The agglomeration effect of urban knowledge spillovers is supported in local economies when understanding the relationship between university investment levels and number of patents filed. 

<--! weak concluding sentence. would prefer if it included some discussion of potential impact. feels veryyyy redundant...-->
