Agglomeration economies-economies of scale resulting from spatial proximity external to a firm-manifest in various ways in urban settings. This paper aims to quantify the impact of knowledge spillovers on local innovation levels. University endowment spending, used as an instrumental variable for research activity and educational output, is spatially plotted against USPTO patent production data to explore potential knowledge spillover effects between universities and local economies. A moderate relationship between university spending and patent production is found, supporting the notion that knowledge spillovers enhance innovation in local economies. The agglomeration effect of urban knowledge spillovers is further supported when examining the relationship between university investment levels and the number of patents filed. These findings suggest that targeted investments in higher education and research institutions can stimulate local innovation ecosystems, offering valuable insights for policymakers aiming to foster regional economic growth through knowledge-based agglomeration.

<--! weak concluding sentence. would prefer if it included some discussion of potential impact. feels veryyyy redundant...-->
