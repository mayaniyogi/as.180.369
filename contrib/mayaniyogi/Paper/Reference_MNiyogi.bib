               universities on geographic clustering of economic activity, labor
               market composition and local productivity and presents evidence
               of local spillovers from universities. I treat the designation of
               land-grant universities in the 1860s as a natural experiment
               after controlling for the confounding factors with a combination
               of synthetic control methods and event-study analyses. Three key
               results are obtained. First, the designation increased local
               population density by 6 percent within 10 years and 45 percent in
               80 years. Second, the designation did not change the relative
               size of local manufacturing sector. Third, the designation
               enhanced local manufacturing output per worker by \$2136 (1840
               dollars; 57 percent) in 80 years while the short-run effects were
               negligible. This positive effect on the productivity in
               non-education sectors suggests the existence of local spillovers
               from universities. Over an 80-year horizon, my results indicate
               that the increase in manufacturing productivity reflects both the
               impact of direct spillovers from universities and general
               agglomeration economies that arise from the increase in
               population.",
