The papers related to Quantitative Urban models discuss various aspects of agglomeration, cluster-driven economic activity, and regional entrepreneurship, emphasizing how geography and industry-specific factors shape economic outcomes. They explore the concentration of economic functions within cities, the factors leading to industry coagglomeration, and the productivity gains from proximity to similar industries. Key findings highlight the importance of input-output dependencies, labor pooling, and intellectual spillovers in shaping agglomeration patterns. Additionally, the presence of strong regional clusters aids entrepreneurship, increases employment and wage growth, and enhances opportunities for new business formation. Potential research projects could include a quantitative analysis of how transportation infrastructure improvements impact local agglomeration economies or an investigation of the role of clusters in the survival and growth of start-ups, comparing regions with and without strong cluster environments.
