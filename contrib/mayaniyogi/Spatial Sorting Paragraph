In recent decades, the spatial sorting of educated workers within U.S. cities has shifted dramatically, driven by rising incomes, changes in local labor demand, and preferences for neighborhood amenities. From the 1980s to today, college graduates have increasingly clustered in city centers, displacing lower-income residents to suburban areas and worsening spatial inequality. This sorting has coincided with rising income inequality, which exacerbates residential segregation as wealthier households increase house prices in desirable areas. Models of spatial equilibrium suggest that gentrification of downtown areas benefit wealthier households at the expense of poorer households, further fueling inequality. At the same time, policies like the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) can help revitalize low-income neighborhoods, though their effects vary by location. Some research ideas include exploring how transportation infrastructure or local policies affect the spatial distribution of workers by education level or investigating the impact of affordable housing initiatives like LIHTC on neighborhood efforts and segregation dynamics.
