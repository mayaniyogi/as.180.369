**Introduction**

The role of universities in driving local economic development has long been a topic of interest in innovation economics. One of the most significant contributions universities make to local economies is through knowledge spilloversâ€”benefits that arise when research and educational activities within universities stimulate innovation beyond their immediate academic environment. These knowledge spillovers, a key component of agglomeration economies, play a critical role in fostering innovation in urban settings. Yet, the specific mechanisms through which university-driven knowledge spillovers influence local innovation, particularly through patent production, remain underexplored. 

Existing literature acknowledges the importance of university research in fostering local economic growth, with scholars like Romer, Jaffe, and Audretsch emphasizing the role of higher education in regional innovation systems. However, debates persist on how university activities, specifically endowment spending, contribute to innovation compared to other factors such as industry collaboration or government funding. While empirical studies provide evidence of positive spillover effects from universities, questions remain about the magnitude of these effects and the conditions under which they are most pronounced.

This paper seeks to quantify the impact of university-driven knowledge spillovers on local innovation, using university endowment spending as an instrumental variable for research intensity and educational output. By applying spatial regression analysis to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) patent production data, this study explores the relationship between university investments and local economies. We aim to fill a gap in the literature by providing a robust quantitative assessment of the agglomeration effects of universities on innovation and offering insights that can inform public policy. Ultimately, the findings of this study have the potential to guide policymakers in targeting investments in higher education to stimulate regional economic growth through knowledge-based agglomeration.
