Agglomeration economies—economies of scale resulting from spatial proximity external to a firm—manifest in various ways in urban settings, yet the role of university-driven knowledge spillovers on local innovation remains underexplored. This paper quantifies the impact of knowledge spillovers on local innovation levels, using university endowment spending as an instrumental variable for research activity and educational output. Spatial regression analysis is applied to USPTO patent production data to explore the relationship between universities and local economies. A moderate but significant relationship between university spending and patent production is found, supporting the notion that knowledge spillovers enhance innovation in local economies. The agglomeration effect is further evidenced when examining the relationship between university investment levels and patent filings. These findings suggest that targeted investments in higher education and research institutions can stimulate local innovation ecosystems, offering valuable insights for policymakers aiming to foster regional economic growth through knowledge-based agglomeration.
