# Potential Ways to Use AI in Project Development

%### Ideas: parts of project: idea creation, paper writing, proofreading paper, code developing, analysis

%### idea creation: finding data sets, understanding potential pitfalls in idea, finding resources to help get ideas, workshopping based off of papers you upload to AI platform

%### paper writing: helping create an outline for paper

%### proofreading paper: synthesis, translation into different language, writing precision, reworking structure

%### code development: can help interpret errors, can fix code, can provide alternative packages or methods for completing a task

%### analysis: can help interpret results, if there are potential convoluting results, can help determine

Generative AI is becoming a transformative tool in economic research, offering new efficiencies and expanding the scope of what economists can achieve. The paper suggests a few main areas where large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can streamline and support researchers’ work: generating ideas and feedback, writing assistance, conducting background research, data analysis, coding, and mathematical problem-solving.

In the ideation and feedback phase, AI can help economists discover relevant datasets, identify research limitations, and suggest useful resources. It can also provide critical feedback on draft papers, helping researchers refine and strengthen their ideas. For writing, AI assists in drafting structured outlines and can enhance clarity and readability by suggesting edits for grammar, style, and tone.

Generative AI also proves useful in background research and data analysis. It helps synthesize complex information, translates research papers across languages, and proposes structural changes to improve comprehension. In coding, AI can help debug, suggest alternative coding methods, and offer guidance to make code more efficient. Additionally, AI’s support with mathematical derivations helps researchers navigate complex calculations.

The integration of generative AI tools in economic research brings benefits ranging from automating routine tasks to providing advanced analytical support. As AI technology advances, economists can expect even more powerful applications to further enhance their research capabilities and productivity. Korinek’s paper also includes resources for economists interested in exploring these tools and staying updated on AI developments in the field.
