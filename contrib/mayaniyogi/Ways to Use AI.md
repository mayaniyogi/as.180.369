Generative AI is emerging as a transformative force in economic research, streamlining complex processes and broadening the scope of economists' capabilities. Korinek's paper highlights how large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are reshaping research workflows in multiple domains: ideation and feedback, writing support, background research, data analysis, coding, and even mathematical derivations.

In the ideation and feedback phases, LLMs assist by suggesting relevant datasets, identifying gaps in methodology, and offering critical feedback on draft ideas. AI-powered tools can evaluate the strengths and limitations of arguments, helping researchers sharpen their insights and shape compelling narratives. Writing support extends to structuring outlines, refining drafts for clarity and flow, and improving grammar and tone, enhancing both readability and professionalism.

Generative AI's capabilities in background research and data analysis allow it to rapidly synthesize complex information, summarize relevant literature, and even translate research papers across languages. These tools offer structured assistance, making complex research topics more accessible and manageable. In coding, AI proves valuable for debugging, providing code efficiency tips, and generating adaptable coding solutions tailored to the researcher’s needs. AI’s emerging capabilities in mathematical problem-solving, such as setting up models and assisting in derivations, make it a powerful ally in tackling intricate calculations.

Beyond automating routine tasks, generative AI empowers economists with advanced analytical capabilities, fostering new efficiencies in research. The paper also provides resources for economists interested in integrating these tools into their workflow, with updates on the evolving applications of AI. As these technologies advance, they promise to unlock even greater potential for productivity and innovation in economic research.

However, several limitations of LLMs remain important to address. These models sometimes "hallucinate," generating plausible-sounding but inaccurate information, and often lack proper citation, making cross-referencing difficult. LLMs are also limited in interpreting visual data, such as figures and charts, which they cannot "see." Privacy concerns arise as some LLMs may be trained on sensitive data, raising the risk of unintentional information exposure. Furthermore, LLMs can exhibit biases present in their training data, which users need to be mindful of to ensure objectivity. Lastly, their knowledge is constrained by training data that only includes information up to a specific cut-off, leaving models without updates on the latest research or developments.
